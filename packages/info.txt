generate_random_hexa
"""
The patrern of gexagones shapes is :
        the third shape of each column represent the result of adding the first and second shape
In the first and second columns only one triangle must be selected
In the last column two triangles must be selected
By calling the function generate_random_indexs, we have a matrix :
[
    "first_column" : [
        shape_one, shape_two, shape_three

    ]
    "second_column" :[
        shape_one, shape_two, shape_three

    ]
    "third_column" :[
        shape_one, shape_two, shape_three

    ]
]
To draw those shapes we simply need to calculate the cordonate of each shape
See the file "shape_cordinate_explication.png"
Finally we generate false responces then we save the question infos.
